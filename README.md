# hackathon2023
My project for the 2023 Hackathon
It's a website meant to be stored on a flash drive so, as a pirate sailing the seven seas, you can plug it into your computer
and access it without any need for an internet connection. The website uses a machine learning algorithm to predict how
many oranges you'll need to bring with you to avoid getting scurvy based on things like your age, weight, sex, and how many
days you'll be out at sea.
